# NVIDIA Tesla T10 Drive
This is the Tesla T10 architecture special driver for Nvidia graphics cards

-----

## ðŸ“‹This is a driver specifically designed for Nvidia Tesla T10 graphics cards, extracted from a virtual machine through a third-party channel

### âœ¨ Highlight: This graphics card driver has complete graphics support, which is different from other modified versions. The driver runs with certain stability and AI acceleration ability, and can correctly recognize the graphics card code, name, and core in CPU Z. Unlike other modified versions, all of which come from T4 and can run on windowS 11 and WINDOWS 10 versions without modifying the registry

###ðŸ¤¨At present, I will not upload the driver body. Please feel free to look forward to it
